# Blackjack

A simple game of single-player blackjack. The goal is to get a higher score than the dealer without going over 21
Face cards count as 10, Ace counts as 1 or 11, whichever is beneficial for the player

To start, both, player and dealer get two cards. Only one of the dealer's cards is visible. Player can then choose to "Hit" or "Stay"
If a player chooses Hit, they get another card. If they choose to Stay, the dealer gets to go until they go over 16, after which they stay. The one with the highest score without going over 21 wins. If, at any point, the player or the dealer goes over 21, they lost instantly

I've kept this pretty simple. Future updates could include allowing multiple players, allowing players to place bets, etc
